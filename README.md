# introduction
My name is Tatiana Peal and I am a freshman at Virginia Tech. I am pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology with a concentration in cybersecurity management and analytics. Some of my hobbies are collecting houseplants and boxing. I am new java as well as all coding, so I can't wait to get started!
